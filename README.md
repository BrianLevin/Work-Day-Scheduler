## Assignment objectives:

The purpose of this assignment was  to create  a calendar  which allows the user to put in events for that time. The calendar is suppose to display a color for each time block within the calendar which represent's the    past hour, current hour, and future hour in real time. The user's event is then stored onto the display screen of the calendar once the user hits the save button. 

## Syntax Used
For this assignment, I used Html and Css to display the Calendar  on the page. I used javascript and jQuery to display the dynamic functionality of the changing colors of the calendar and the saving events. I used Moment.Js to append the current time on top of the page and to get the past, present, and future event colors to display on the calendar.



## What I learned

I learned I need more work on understanding  and utilizing the proper syntax of jQuery and  Javascript.
