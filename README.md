Timed Quiz Work Day Scheduler

Assignment Objectives

For this Assignment, we had to create a multiple choice timed quiz that would total up the score of the users answers and store the scores in the browser. The user had to complete the quiz within 60 seconds and would get penalized and get their time subtracted if they got the answer wrong. The user can then save their total score in the local storage after completing the quiz or erase their score in the local storage. The user can play as many times as they want.
